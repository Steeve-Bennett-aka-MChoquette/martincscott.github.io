# Supabase Authentication System Analysis Plan

## 1. Static Site Authentication Context

This project is deployed to GitHub Pages as a static site, which has significant implications for how authentication works:

- All authentication happens client-side in the browser
- No server-side processing is available after deployment
- Protected routes rely entirely on client-side checks
- Authentication state is managed in browser storage

## 2. Supabase Client Setup for Static Sites

- Analysis of `src/utils/supabase.js` implementation
- Public environment variables usage and security implications
- Build-time vs. runtime client initialization
- Mock client for SSR/build process
- Error handling and fallbacks

## 3. Authentication Flows in a Static Context

- Email/Password authentication implementation
  - Sign up process and email confirmation
  - Login process and session creation
  - Password reset flow
- OAuth authentication with GitHub and Google
  - Redirect handling in a static site
  - OAuth callback processing
- Success and error handling paths

## 4. Protected Content in a Static Site

- Client-side authentication checks
- Redirect mechanisms for unauthenticated users
- Security limitations of client-side protection
- Best practices for protecting content in static sites

## 5. User Experience Considerations

- Initial page load experience
- Authentication state persistence
- Form validation and error feedback
- Internationalization of authentication components

## 6. Security Analysis for Static Site Authentication

- Client-side authentication limitations
- Exposure of public Supabase keys
- Session storage security
- CORS and API security considerations
- Potential vulnerabilities and mitigations

## 7. Implementation Recommendations

- Enhancing security within static site constraints
- Alternative approaches for sensitive content
- Performance optimizations
- User experience improvements

## 8. Diagrams and Visualizations

- Authentication flow diagrams
- Client-side vs. server-side authentication comparison
- Security boundary visualization
- Component interaction diagrams
